            <p>We all know Albert Einstein was a famous physicist, but most of us are unaware of the fact that he was
                actively involved in politics much of his life. He campaigned against war, advocated for socialism and
                opposed using nuclear weapons. He believed that scientists have a moral obligation towards humanity. In
                this short essay Einstein offers a <span class="highlight">moral critique of capitalism</span>.</p>

            <blockquote>The economic anarchy of capitalism is in my opinion the real source of evil.</blockquote>

            <p>While many economists have criticised his proposed solution as economically underdeveloped, a wide range
                of political philosophers acknowledge that he was morally right. Delighted to read something like this
                from an extraordinary thinker.</p>
